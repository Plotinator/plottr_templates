Often the Hero faces a large sacrifice, a death, or a significant loss which breaks them down to their lowest. The Hero must transition through a form of death and rebirth, transforming into a stronger, more powerful version of themselves. If the Hero is successful, this rebirth grants them the strength to defeat the Antagonist and new insights which alter their perception for the rest of the story, giving them the strength to fulfill their duties. If the Hero fails, the Journey's success is thrown into question, while the tension and the stakes heighten."
