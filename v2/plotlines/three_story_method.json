The term “Inciting Incident” is often used in screenwriting and movie production as well as novel writing, but we chose to call it “conflict” because it’s more specific. This single event does not necessarily need to be tense, dramatic, or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting incident will depend on the genre. However, it does need to force the Protagonist into changing, which then “incites” the act. Without change precipitated by conflict, there is no story."

This single event does not necessarily need to be tense, dramatic, or a life-or-death situation—the nature of the inciting incident will depend on the genre. However, it does need to force the Protagonist into changing, which then “incites” the act. Without change precipitated by conflict, there is no story."
