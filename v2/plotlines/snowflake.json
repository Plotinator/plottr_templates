The Third Disaster is something bad that forces your lead Character AND the villain (if there is a villain) to commit to some final showdown that will decide who wins and who loses. That is, they must both commit to end the story. As an example, in the original Star Wars movie, at the end of Act 2, Luke and his comrades reach the rebel planet, where they learn that the storm troopers put a tracking device on the Millennium Falcon. The Death Star is now approaching the rebel planet, and Darth Vader means to destroy the planet and end the Rebellion. This is terrible! The rebels can all run and hide, fragmenting the Rebellion. Or they can fight to the death. They choose to make a last stand. The rest of the story is the final showdown, in which the rebels attack the Death Star while it moves into position to destroy the rebel planet. One side will win and one will lose, and the clock is ticking!"

Your lead Character has spent the first half of Act 2 trying to achieve their Storygoal, but they've been pursuing a path that won't work. The Second Disaster is a bad thing that happens at the midpoint of the story that forces your Character to try a new approach. This new approach will actually work. As an example, in the original Star Wars movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi is killed by Darth Vader at the midpoint of the story. Up till now, Luke has been following Obi-Wan and just doing what he says. Now he has to step up and start making his own decisions--and he needs to actually start using the Force. He will never win unless he becomes strong in the Force, and he has the second half of Act 2 to get strong."
