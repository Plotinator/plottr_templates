While some clues are starting to fall into place, others assumed to be valuable thus far are now meaningless, and logic must be applied to force a new way of grasping an understanding of the uncertainties. This beat is a bit of a roller coaster, as the Sleuth reveals the results of the investigation. The reader, as well as the Sleuth and other characters, are given an opportunity to review what is known and assess the possibilities."

They have been on the wrong track, and tragic events make that obvious. There may be the appearance of a second body, the death of a major suspect, or the discovery of evidence that rules out the most likely suspect. Either way, the mystery takes a completely different turn. Often the Sleuth faces a large sacrifice, a death, or a significant loss which breaks them down to their lowest. The Sleuth must transition through a form of death and rebirth, whether that is a death of their best ideas, or the literal death of someone close to them. The greater the emotional impact the better. If the Sleuth is successful, this grants them new insights which alter their perception for the rest of the story, giving them the determination to solve the crime. If the Sleuth fails, their success is thrown into question, while the tension and the stakes heighten."
